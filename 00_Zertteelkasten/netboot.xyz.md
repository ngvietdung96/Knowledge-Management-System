your favorite operating systems in one place

[netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz/) lets you [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) boot various operating system installers or utilities from a single tool over the network. This lets you use one media for many types of operating systems or tools. The [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/) project is used to provide a user friendly menu from within the BIOS that lets you easily choose the operating system you want along with any specific types of versions or bootable flags.
