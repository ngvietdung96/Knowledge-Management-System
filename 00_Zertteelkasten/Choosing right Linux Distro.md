## What is in a Distribution
Windows and Mac are called [[Operation System]]]], NOT distributions… but in Linux this isn’t the case. Why? That is because each Linux offering has different options at its core. With Windows and Mac you always get the same bootloader, file manager, etc. and in Linux these can differ drastically from one to the next. So this is what makes up the Linux distribution.
### Bootloader

### Init System

### Display Render

### Display Manager

### Desktop Environment

### Package Managers
