Dopamine is discovered in late 1950s, it was discovered as the precursor (building block) from [[epinephrin]] or [[adrenaline]] is made.

Reward system (reward pathway): [video explain](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/executive-systems-of-the-brain/drug-abuse-and-drug-addictions/v/reward-pathway-in-the-brain).
[[Prefrontal cortex]] control when and how much dopamine is released, it also act like a break on the dopamine system (without that break, you will be purely a pleasure seeking animal, no basic for regulating your behavior in term of trying get things make you feel good).

Dopamine release rate:
- When normal, not exciting, not depressed, not highly motivated ,reward pathway release dopamine at a low rate about 3 - 4 times per second. 
- When hungry, we think about good meal, dopamine release at 50% to the base line. 
- Sex --> 100% increase
- Nicotine (Cigarettes, nicotine supplement form) --> 150% increase (very quickly within second).
- Cocaine and amphetemine --> 1000% within 10 second.
- Just thinking about these things can increase the  amount to the same degree as consuming or archiving these things.
- Video game with high novelty is big stimulus of dopamine (between nicotine and cocaine).
- Social media initially can be quite high, but it seems like that there's a taper in amount dopamine, but people still addicted.

[Review book "Dopamine author" author: Too much pleasure can lead to addiction and How to break the cycle and find balance](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/31/1090009509/addiction-how-to-break-the-cycle-and-find-balance#:~:text=A%20dopamine%20hit%20brings%20about,%E2%80%93%20food%2C%20water%2C%20shelter.)
`A dopamine hit bring about pleasure, and then is quickly followed by pain, or a come-down, in order to keep us motivated. 
`This balancing see-saw of pleasure and pain made sense in the early time of humans, when we had to constantly search for our basic needs - food, water, shelter. It's really and ingenious method to make sure that no matter we do, that's pleasurable, it doesn't last very long and it's followed by pain so that immediately we're searching again.

Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure, it is about motivation and desire to pursue more and in order to reduce the amount of pain.

Dopamine and serotonin can be though of exteroception, is focus on outside word (everything beyond confines of skin). 
"Here and Now" molecule (Serotonin neurotransmitters) can be though of interoception, focus on thing that are happening internally (within the confines of skin).
