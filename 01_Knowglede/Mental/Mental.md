# Motivation

**Motivation** is fundamental to our daily life, it allow us to get up in the morning, pursue long-term goals or short-term goal. Motivation and the chemistry of motivation is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.

[[Dopamine|Molecule Dopamine]] is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement. Whether or not we move, whether or not we have the desire to overcome the social, financial,.. barriers, all is depend on this molecule.
It lies at the center of so **many great thing in life** and of so **many terrible aspects of life** (addiction and certain mental disease).  

Motivation is a two-part process which is balancing pleasure and pain.
