The complete list of rules for Cert C coding standard is available in the document "CERT C Coding Standard" by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The document is available for purchase on their website, or it can be downloaded for free from some other sources online.

Each rule in the standard is identified by a unique identifier code, such as FIO34-C or EXP30-C. These codes are used to reference specific rules within the document. The document also provides detailed explanations and examples of each rule and why it is important to follow it.

In addition to the official documents, there are also various online resources that provide information and explanations of the Cert C coding standard and its rules. For example, the CERT Secure Coding Wiki provides a summary of the standard and links to resources on each rule. Another helpful resource is the Google C++ Style Guide, which incorporates many of the guidelines from the Cert C coding standard.





Cert C (also known as CERT C Coding Standard) is a set of guidelines for secure coding in the C programming language. It was developed by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and is widely used in industries such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and healthcare, where safety-critical systems are developed.

The Cert C coding standard provides rules and recommendations to prevent common security vulnerabilities in C code, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, and memory leaks. The guidelines cover topics such as:

1. Memory management: Rules for dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and arrays that help avoid memory-related vulnerabilities.
    
2. Control flow: Recommendations for the use of loops, conditional statements, and switch statements that help prevent code injection and other vulnerabilities.
    
3. Input validation: Guidelines for validating input data before using it in the program, which helps prevent buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities caused by incorrect input.
    
4. Error handling: Best practices for handling errors and exceptions so that they don't lead to security vulnerabilities.
    

Implementing the Cert C coding standard can help improve the security and reliability of C code, especially in safety-critical environments where even minor bugs can have serious consequences.








To use MISRA, you need to follow its guidelines in your C or C++ code. Here are the steps for implementing the MISRA guidelines:

1. Understand the guidelines: Read through the MISRA guidelines to understand the rules and recommendations that apply to your project. The guidelines are designed to promote safety, reliability, and maintainability, so it's important to follow them carefully.
    
2. Evaluate your codebase: Conduct a code review of your existing codebase to identify any non-compliant code that may need to be refactored or rewritten. You can use static analysis tools to assist in this process.
    
3. Establish coding standards: Establish coding standards and best practices using MISRA as a guide. Make sure that all developers on your team follow these standards to ensure consistency across the project.
    
4. Use automated tools: Use automated tools like static code analysis tools to check your code for compliance with MISRA rules and recommendations. These tools can help you find and fix errors quickly and efficiently.

1. Verification and validation: Verify and validate your code to ensure that it meets the requirements of the guidelines. This step involves testing your code under different scenarios and conditions to ensure that it is reliable and safe.
    
6. Document your process: Document your process for following the MISRA guidelines, including coding standards, tools used, and verification and validation procedures. This documentation will help you demonstrate compliance if it becomes necessary to do so.
    

By following these steps and adhering to the guidelines set forth in the MISRA standard, you can improve the quality, safety, and reliability of your software code.


**is Cert C guideline open for everyone?**
The CERT C coding standard is developed and maintained by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University. The standard is publicly available, and anyone can access it on the SEI website or through other sources online.

While the CERT C coding standard is not open source, it is freely available to the public, and there are no restrictions on its use or distribution. Developers can use the guidelines provided in the standard as a reference when developing software in C language, even if they are not required to comply with the specific CERT C standard.

It's worth noting that the CERT C coding standard itself is not a guarantee of secure code. Good coding practices, testing, and manual code review are equally important to ensure that your code meets the necessary standards of security and reliability. Additionally, developers should be aware that the CERT C coding standard is just one of many resources available for writing safe and secure code in C language, and other resources may provide additional guidance and best practices.
