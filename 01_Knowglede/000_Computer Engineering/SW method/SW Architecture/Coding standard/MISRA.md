The complete set of rules for MISRA C is available in the "MISRA C:2012 Guidelines for the use of the C language in critical systems" document, which is published by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA). The document contains a total of 143 guidelines, each with a unique identifier code, such as Rule 3.1 or Rule 14.4.

Some examples of the MISRA C rules include:

- Rule 1.1: Use only those features of the language that are defined as part of the ISO/IEC standard.
- Rule 5.1: Expressions resulting from the expansion of macro parameters shall be enclosed in parentheses.
- Rule 10.1: The value of a control expression shall not be changed by any statement within the associated substatement.
- Rule 14.1: The right-hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain persistent side effects.
- Rule 20.9: The input/output library <stdio.h> shall not be used in production code.

Each rule is accompanied by a rationale that explains why the rule is important and what it intends to prevent. The document also provides guidance on how to apply the rules and how to deal with cases where compliance may not be possible.




**is MISRA guideline open for everyone?**
The MISRA C guidelines are developed and maintained by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) and are available for purchase on their website. The guidelines are intended for use by developers working on safety-critical systems in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and defense.

While anyone can purchase the MISRA C guidelines and use them as a guide for developing software, there may be restrictions on redistributing or modifying the guidelines due to their proprietary nature. Additionally, compliance with the guidelines themselves may be regulated or required by certain industries or organizations.

It's worth noting that the general principles and best practices outlined in the MISRA C guidelines are not unique to the standard itself. Many of the recommendations and rules presented in the guidelines are widely accepted as good coding practices for writing safe, reliable, and maintainable code in the C programming language. Developers can benefit from reviewing the guidelines and incorporating their recommendations into their coding practices, even if they are not required to comply with the specific MISRA C standard.
