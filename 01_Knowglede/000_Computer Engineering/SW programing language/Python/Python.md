## Getting Started
Python can be easy to pick up whether you're a first time programmer or you're experienced with other languages. The following pages are a useful first step to get on your way writing programs with Python!

- [Beginner's Guide, Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
- [Beginner's Guide, Non-Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)
- [Beginner's Guide, Download & Installation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
- [Code sample and snippets for Beginners](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples)

## Friendly & Easy to Learn
The community hosts conferences and meetups, collaborates on code, and much more. Python's documentation will help you along the way, and the mailing lists will keep you in touch.

- [Conferences and Workshops](https://www.python.org/community/workshops/)
- [Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/)
- [Mailing Lists](https://www.python.org/community/lists) and [IRC channels](https://www.python.org/community/irc/)

## Applications
The [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/) hosts thousands of third-party modules for Python. Both Python's standard library and the community-contributed modules allow for endless possibilities.
