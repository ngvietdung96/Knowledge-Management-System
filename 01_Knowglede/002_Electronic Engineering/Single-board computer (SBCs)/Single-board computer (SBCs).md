# Single-board computer (SBCs)

A **single-board computer** (**SBC**) is a complete [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") built on a single [circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_board "Circuit board"), with [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor")(s), [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random-access memory"), [input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers are commonly made as demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as [embedded computer controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system"). Many types of [home computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer "Home computer") or [portable computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_computer "Portable computer") integrate all their functions onto a single [printed circuit board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board "Printed circuit board").

Unlike a desktop [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), single board computers often do not rely on [expansion slots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_slot "Expansion slot") for peripheral functions or [expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_card "Expansion card"). Single board computers have been built using a wide range of [microprocessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor"). Simple designs, such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use [static RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_RAM "Static RAM") and low-cost 32- or 64-bit processors like [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_processor "ARM processor"). Other types, such as [blade servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_server "Blade server"), would perform similar to a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") computer, only in a more compact format.

A [computer-on-module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-on-module "Computer-on-module") is a type of single-board computer made to plug into a carrier board, baseboard, or [backplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane "Backplane") for system expansion.
